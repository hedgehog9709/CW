							Nike co-founder and chairman Phil Knight has been called the most powerful man in sports, changing the way the world works out and making athletes of all ages feel like they can be a champion. But long before "Just Do It" became a household phrase and before the iconic swoosh was instantly recognizable, Phil was just a boy from Portland, Oregon, who dreamed of playing in the majors.

							"Up until the time I was 14 years old, I was sure that I was going to be a big-league baseball player. But that dream came to a rude awakening when I got cut from my high school baseball team," he says. So instead of the baseball diamond, Phil took to the track. In 1955, he enrolled in the University of Oregon, where he ran track for renowned coach Bill Bowerman. 

							Phil calls Bill "the greatest track coach that ever lived," but aside from their love of running, they also shared the belief that the existing track shoes were slowing runners down. So Phil began importing better-quality running shoes from Japan, and in 1964, with a handshake and $500 apiece, Phil and Bill launched Blue Ribbon Sports. 

							Today, Nike works with many world-class athletes like Serena Williams, Mia Hamm, Roger Federer and Tiger Woods. At the headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, the Nike Sports Research Lab often hosts elite athletes to test new products. "They're very demanding. They want lighter, better, faster shoes and lighter, better, faster clothes ," Phil says. "Meeting sports athletes that are the best in the world is a thrill to this day. That never changes. I was that way when I was 12, and I'm that way now."

							Phil says there are definitely days when he marvels at what Nike has become over the years. "We knew the industry would get bigger. We had no idea ... we would compete as successfully as we have. It was all a labor of love in the early days and really to this day," he says. "It's a fabulous industry, and the people who work out there, they love being in it. I mean, it's sports, it's fitness, it's international." 

							One of Nike's most famous partnerships is with global inspiration and sports icon Michael Jordan. The company signed the basketball player in 1984, before he had even stepped on the court for the Chicago Bulls. "He was a great player, he was handsome, he was articulate, he was educated and he was perfect," Phil says."He was sent from central casting, and we jumped on it right away." 

							Through the years, Michael Jordan has become a brand within the brand. Nike sells about double the Jordan product today compared to what they did when he was playing at the peak of his career, Phil says. "It's become more than just the man," he says. "It stands for something by itself."
